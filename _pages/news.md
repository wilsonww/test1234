I am thrilled to share that my research paper, "Exploring the Impact of Virtual Reality on Mental Health Interventions," has been accepted for presentation at the American Psychological Association (APA) conference in 2024. I am eagerly anticipating the opportunity to discuss my findings and insights with fellow researchers in San Francisco.

I am honored to have been awarded the Student Excellence Award for Innovation and Leadership in Technology by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) School of Engineering.

I recently presented a study titled "[Understanding the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Improving Healthcare Outcomes](https://www.jhu.edu/)" at the 2023 Healthcare Innovation Symposium. The study explores the potential of AI-driven solutions in revolutionizing patient care and medical diagnostics.
