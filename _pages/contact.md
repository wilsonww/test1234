I'm currently a graduate student pursuing my studies at Cornell University, focusing on Linguistics. Originally from the United States, I've embarked on an academic journey that has taken me across borders. Currently, I'm studying abroad in Germany, immersing myself in the rich academic and cultural landscape of this vibrant country. My time here has been incredibly rewarding, allowing me to engage with top scholars in my field and broaden my perspective on global issues.

In addition to my studies in Germany, I recently had the opportunity to visit the UK for a research project. This experience was invaluable, as it allowed me to explore different academic approaches and collaborate with scholars from diverse backgrounds. Currently, I'm continuing my academic endeavors abroad at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland. Here, I'm delving into research projects that delve into Linguistics, further enhancing my academic growth and contributing to the global scholarly community.
