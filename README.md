Options for naming this repository after you "Create a new repository" after clicking "Use this template"

github.com/githubusername

Given your username is "githubusername"

- Naming the repository as githubusername.github.io for github.com/githubusername/githubusername.github.io
  - The resultant jekyll website will be built and found at https://githubusername.github.io

- Naming the repository as portfoliosite for github.com/githubusername/portfoliosite
  - The resultant jekyll website will be built and found at https://githubusername.github.io/portoliosite

Also keep in mind that one must make changes to allow the github actions (github continuous integration automations) to act on the repository and build the jekyll site
